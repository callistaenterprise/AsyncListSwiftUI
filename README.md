# AsyncListSwiftUI

Sample code to complement an article about dynamic lists in SwiftUI. 
You find the article here: 
[Dynamic Lists with SwiftUI Using Swift Concurrency for Asynchronous Data Loading](https://callistaenterprise.se/blogg/teknik/2022/03/04/swiftui-async-list-infrastructure/)

The article demonstrates a list infrastructure that facilitates the separation of concerns between the data model and UI. 
It also makes use of Swift Concurrency features (async/await etc) for the asynchronous parts.
